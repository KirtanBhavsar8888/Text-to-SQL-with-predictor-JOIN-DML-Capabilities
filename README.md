# Text-to-SQL with Predictor JOIN DML Capabilities

A powerful Python-based application that combines **Text-to-SQL query generation** with **data prediction capabilities**. This project leverages advanced machine learning models, including **LSTM for time series forecasting**, to provide seamless query execution and predictive analytics on uploaded datasets.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Text-to-SQL Query Generation**: Convert natural language questions into SQL queries for efficient database interaction.
- **Multi-Table JOIN Support**: Execute complex SQL queries involving multiple tables.
- **Predictive Analytics**:
  - Regression for continuous value prediction.
  - Classification for categorical prediction.
  - Time Series Forecasting using LSTM and other models.
- **Manual Problem Type Override**: Flexibility to switch between regression, classification, and time series detection.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate large datasets for testing predictive models.

## üìä Usage

### Text-to-SQL Query Generation
1. Upload your database file (e.g., `data.db`).
2. Enter a natural language query into the text box (e.g., "Show all employees earning more than $5000").
3. View the generated SQL query and its execution results.

### Predictive Analytics
1. Upload your dataset (e.g., `synthetic_dataset.csv`).
2. Select the target column and input features.
3. Choose the problem type (regression, classification, or time series).
4. Train models and visualize results, including feature importance and predictions.

### Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
1. Upload a time series dataset (e.g., `Time_Series_data.csv`).
2. Select the target column and date column.
3. Train the LSTM model and view forecast results.
